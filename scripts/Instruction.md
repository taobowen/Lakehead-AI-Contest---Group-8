## Using the Dataset

[USA Computing Olympiad](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=open24results)

This dataset includes the problem description, sample input/output, and test data.

- The problem descriptions are not directly exportable; they need to be converted into a PDF file or captured as PNG screenshots.
- The test data is provided in a zip file.

## ChatGPT

Used ChatGPT's Assistant's Code Interpreter. For details, see [OpenAI Code Interpreter Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/code-interpreter).

This model supports file handling.

### Preparation

Before generating code, place the problem screenshot file `problem.png` and the test case file `testCase.zip` in the same folder, as shown below.

### Potential Issues and Solutions

1. **Unable to Read File**  
   **Solution**: Restart the kernel and re-run all code.

2. **Model Only Returns Reasoning Process Without Code**  
   **Solution**: There's no need to start from scratch; simply resend the message by executing `chatBot.sendMsg()` again.

3. **Generated Code Fails to Run**  
   **Solution**: Usually, this occurs due to minor issues like undeclared variables or missing imports. Simply correct them and re-run.

## Phind

[Phind](https://www.phind.com/)

This model does not support API calls or file handling and can only be interacted with through the chat interface.

To **solve programming problems**, it’s recommended to use ChatGPT first to convert the `problem.png` file into text, then input that text into Phind. Since Phind does not support file handling, any generated code cannot be tested directly on the platform.

To compare the test case pass rates between the programs generated by both models, it’s best to use the test running code previously generated by ChatGPT.
